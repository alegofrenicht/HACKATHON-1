Spongebob game Beta.
Wow! What a fun idea .
I can see that you put a lot of work into this. You have demonstrated everything you've learnt 
in the past couple of months. 
I can see that you understand the studied material very well.
Using event listeners, DOM manipulations, Object methods, advanced array methods...
I like how you created animations with settimeout, setinterval,clearinterval...
Great styling too through dom manipulation.
Your logic is written well.
Very good!!!!! Keep at it.
